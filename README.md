# General windows / BDO setup
General PC setup and tweaks along with BDO setup i personally do, will cover a basic general setup and will go more indeth down the rabbit hole of trying to optismise your PC. 
Taken info from many resources and put them together in this guide for the avg bdo gamer / casual trying to improve their experience.

# Choosing your OS!
Win10 vs Win11
Pick whichever OS you like better if you're on reletivly new CPU i would say go win11.

General [guide](https://youtube.com/shorts/VfOAjO3BfRc?feature=share) on creating a windows boot usb 

If you go down the windows 11 path would say try out [tiny11](https://youtu.be/qiF30VGfGhA?t=172) cuts out most of the reinstalled apps which you will not have to remove later on your own (edge is completely removed in tiny11)

## Pre install
If you're going to install a fresh OS i would reccomend to predownload your basic needed drivers (chipset,Lan,GPU) and put them on a folder names "Drivers" for example on a usb or 2nd drive. I would suggest going onto this site - https://ninite.com/ 
and create a installer of the programs you use, there are tools  later in this guide that have a similar feature but i like to create on of these now incase just kind of a failsafe.

### Windows installation 
I like to unplug my ethernet cable when installing windows if you're on wifi and not using a cable you will not need to worry about this. 

Once in windows install your drivers that you pre-download and restart when promted to.
